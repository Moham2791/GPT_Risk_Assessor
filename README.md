**Cybersecurity Awareness & LLM-Driven Risk Assessment Toolkit**

This project aims to modernize and personalize cybersecurity awareness and training by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The toolkit is designed to simplify complex security concepts, deliver tailored guidance, and explore automated risk-assessment capabilities powered by advanced AI.

**Project Overview**

The system operates across two primary modules, each focused on enhancing cybersecurity understanding and improving individual and organizational security posture.

**Module 1 — Personalized Cybersecurity Awareness
**
This module focuses on generating custom cybersecurity awareness content using user-specific data and real-time threat intelligence.

**Process Flow**

**User Data Collection**
Gather relevant user information to understand context and baseline awareness.

**Cybersecurity News Ingestion**
Scrape and process current cybersecurity news and threat updates.

**LLM Prompt Generation**
Combine user data with the latest security news to build a contextualized prompt.

**Personalized Guidance Delivery**
Use the LLM to simplify, personalize, and present tailored awareness content.

**Module 2 — LLM-Augmented Vulnerability & Risk Assessment**

This module explores the use of LLMs to identify vulnerabilities and evaluate security risks based on user-provided technical data.

**Process Flow**

**User Data Collection**
Gather system, environment, or asset information relevant to security posture.

**Vulnerability Discovery**
Query CVE databases to identify potential vulnerabilities related to the provided data.

**LLM Prompt Generation****
Build a structured prompt integrating identified vulnerabilities.

**Actionable Security Recommendations**
Use the LLM to simplify technical findings and deliver clear, actionable mitigation steps.

**Risk Evaluation**
Estimate risk levels before and after implementing recommended security controls.

**Note**
LLM technologies and capabilities evolve rapidly; system behavior, accuracy, and implementation recommendations may change as underlying models advance.
